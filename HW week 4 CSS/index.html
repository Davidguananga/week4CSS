            <p>Hi, David Guananga here; I'm a native of Spain. After ten years, I left to move to New York. I am a graphic designer, illustrator, and photographer .

            <h2>My Favorite Artist</h2>
            <p>TThe Spanish vocalist Rosalía, also known as Rosila Vila Tobella, is my favorite performer. She incorporates a wide range of musical styles into her compositions, which gives her amazing voice and distinctive musical taste. Her unique blend of contemporary pop and urban elements with traditional flamenco creates a new and inventive sound that appeals to listeners all over the world. Rosalía has established herself as a rising star in the music business with her forceful performances and intriguing images.

            <h2>Paula Scher</h2>
            <p>Paula Scher is an American graphic designer and painter. She was born in Washington, D.C., in 1948. She is very well known, like the goddess of graphic design, for her artwork and her influence. One of the things she likes is typography. Scher's typography has a distinct style that combines boldness and playfulness, making her work instantly recognizable. She also runs a design cooperative called Pentagram; this cooperative was founded by friends.

            <h2>ArPod Max</h2>
            <p>My favorite item is the AirPods Max. The reason is because it is the first object I bought with my savings. One day I found out about these airpods, but at first they didn't catch my attention. But one day, while on the train, I was using my normal airpods. I always listen to music anywhere, but on the train I was always bothered by the noise it made, so I thought I'd get some airpods that could cancel the noise. After a few days, I found out that AirPods Max are noise-canceling outside, and from that moment on, I knew I needed them. AirPods Max are the most expensive item I've ever bought, and I try to use them as much as possible and also take good care of them so they last a long time.
